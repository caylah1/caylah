# Exploring the Role of Transportation Networks on Spotted Lanternfly Populations

In recent years, a new invasive species has shown up on the shores of the United States: the Spotted Lanternfly, or Lycorma delicatula. This gray and red insect hails from eastern Asia and was first identified in Pennsylvania in 2014. (University of Maryland Extension) Since its arrival, it has bloomed in population, with the main host being the tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) which is also an invasive species in Maryland. 

By using census data on transportation vehicles in Maryland as well as INaturalist sightings, we will be able to see if lanternflies are traveling along transportation routes

Using various geographic software, an analysis was run on the two variables, Local Moran's I, which puts the values of the points in relation to the points next to it, and Global Moran's I, which puts the points next to all the points on the map.

In conclusion, the usage of Moranâ€™s I analysis as well as other statistic indicators, shows a strong correlation between spotted lanternfly sightings and transportation routes. This could be the root cause of the rapid population boom in recent years, with the increase of shipping and vehicles traveling each day. Although difficult, making sure all trucks and trains leaving lanternfly-infested zones should be checked for eggs, as well as larvae from the insect.
